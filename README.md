## Usage

TabSearch requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Note that the `dist/` folder only contains static assets. To get the javascript and manifest.json in there compile the source first.

Step 0: If you plan on sending pull-request, you should fork the repository.

Step 1: Clone the [TabSearch](https://github.com/reblws/tab-search) repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/reblws/tab-search.git
```
If you forked the repo, just replace the clone url with your own.

Step 2: Navigate to the root of the directory you cloned and install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Step 3: You'll need to compile the changes from `src/` into the `dist/` folder. The following scripts are available to help with this

```
# Starts a live server watching for changes in `src/` and outputs them to `dist/`
# NOTE: Need to restart this command if changing one of the manifest files
npm start

# Opens Firefox with add-on installed from the files in `dist/`, automatically reloads the extension on each change found in `dist/`
npm run watch:firefox
```

Step 4: Build for production
```
npm run build:firefox
```

If you want to build or watch for Chrome just use `start:chrome` or `build:chrome` instead. This just changes the manifest.json file so it doesn't raise any errors. There's no `watch` command  for Chrome yet.
